        <p>At Cake Shop, we believe that every celebration deserves a delicious cake. 
            Our cakes are made with the finest ingredients and crafted with love to mamake your 
            moments special. 
            Our journey began with one humble shop in Fort, Mumbai and grew to over one thousand 
            locations throughout India under the inspiring vision of our founder, Hussein Khorakiwala
             in the early 1956. Since then, our family has combined their years of experience with the
              vision of a community of collaborative shop owners, suppliers and other partners working
               together to create a brand name in the market to grow their business to what it is today.

            In order to achieve this, the family offers franchises to budding entrepreneurs & distributors 
            partnering with them to ensure success and excellence.</p>
